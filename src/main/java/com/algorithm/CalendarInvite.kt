/**
 * You are in-charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age.
 * When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.
 * Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
 * For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have candles of height 1, 3, 2, 3
 * she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candle is of height and there are such candles.
 * Sample Input 0 :
 * 4
 * 3 2 1 3
 * Sample Output 0
 * 2
 * Explanation 0
 * We have one candle of height 1, one candle of height 2, and two candles of height 3.
 * Your niece only blows out the tallest candles, meaning the candles where heght == 3.
 * Because there are 2 such candles,
 * we print 2 on a new line.
